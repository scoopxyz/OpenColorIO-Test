# Overview

Most users will likely want to use the OpenColorIO that comes precompiled with their applications. See the Compatible Software for further details on each application.

Note that OCIO configurations are required to do any ‘real’ work, and are available separately on the Downloads section of this site. Example images are also available. For assistance customizing .ocio configurations, contact ocio-user.

Step 1: set the OCIO environment-variable to /path/to/your/profile.ocio
Step 2: Launch supported application.
If you are on a platform that is not envvar friendly, most applications also provide a menu option to select a different OCIO configuration after launch.

Please be sure to select a profile that matches your color workflow (VFX work typically requires a different profile than animated features). If you need assistance picking a profile, email ocio-user.
